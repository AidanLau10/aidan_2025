    "- When initializing the data for my question table, the spring boot application would run but when I checked sqlite.db, I couldn't see any entrees for question. I found out that the questionFound variable was singular but in my comparison I was checking \"questionFound.size() == 0\". This is only applicable for a list of objects but I had a singular object. I changed it to \"questionFound == null\" and it worked. \n",

Try running \"Pull\" first to integrate your changes.\" I solved it by moving all the files to a backup repo and then tried committing my changes one at a time. I found out when I got to committing .env, it would give me an error. I figured out that it was because I stored secret keys that I don't want exposing to the internet so I added it to .gitignore and it allowed me to commit.\n",
