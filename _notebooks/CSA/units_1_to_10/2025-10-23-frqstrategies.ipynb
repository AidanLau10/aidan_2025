    "- Index Out of Bound Exception: going over the bounds of array (e.g. you have a 5 element list called “array” but you use array[5] to access the last element)\n",
    "- Misusing .get()/[]: .get() function is used to get a specific item in an ArrayList, while the square brackets “[]” are used to access specific elements in arrays\n",
    "- Jagged Arrays: not all 2d arrays in Java have the same column sizes, so assuming that all 2d arrays are congruent might lead to index out of bounds exceptions\n",
    "- Not Initializing 2D Arrays Correctly: when initializing 2d arrays, make sure to follow this format: int[][] arr = new int[a][b], where your a and b are your row and column size.\n",
    "- Copying Arrays Incorrectly: using = to copy an array only creates a reference copy, not an actual copy.\n",

    "### 0 - Penalties\n",
    "\n",
    "These are ways to lose points. They apply to all kinds of FRQs, not just classes-related ones. Do not do these things!!\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Array/Collection Access Confusion (`[]` vs `get`)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation**  \n",
    "This penalty is applied when there is confusion between accessing elements in arrays and collections:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "int[] arr = {1, 2, 3};\n",
    "System.out.println(arr[1]); // Correct for arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "ArrayList<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();\n",
    "list.add(10);\n",
    "System.out.println(list[0]); // Incorrect: should use list.get(0)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Extraneous Code That Causes Side Effects\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation**  \n",
    "This penalty is given for including unnecessary code that impacts the program's behavior, often unintentionally. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public int addNumbers(int a, int b) {\n",
    "    System.out.println(\"Adding numbers...\"); // Side-effect: unnecessary printing\n",
    "    return a + b;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Local Variables Used but None Declared\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation**  \n",
    "This penalty is for using local variables in a method or block without declaring them:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public int calculateSum() {\n",
    "    total += 5; // Incorrect: 'total' is used but not declared\n",
    "    int total = 0; // This declaration should come first\n",
    "    total += 5; // Correct\n",
    "    return total;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Destruction of Persistent Data\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation**  \n",
    "This deduction is for modifying data in a way that unintentionally alters persistent values (like those referenced by parameters):\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public void changeName(StringBuilder name) {\n",
    "    name.append(\" Smith\"); // Modifies the original object unintentionally\n",
    "}\n",
    "StringBuilder studentName = new StringBuilder(\"John\");\n",
    "changeName(studentName);\n",
    "System.out.println(studentName); // Output: \"John Smith\" (persistent data altered)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Void Method or Constructor That Returns a Value\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation**  \n",
    "This deduction is for attempting to return a value from a method or constructor declared void:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public void printMessage() {\n",
    "    return \"Hello\"; // Incorrect: void methods cannot return a value\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "public class MyClass {\n",
    "    public MyClass() {\n",
    "        return; // Correct: constructors can return nothing implicitly\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n"
