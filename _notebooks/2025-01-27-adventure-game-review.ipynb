    "- **TransitionToLevel Roadblock:**  \n",
    "  The biggest challenge I encountered was adding `transitionToLevel`.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Saw that first gameObject being checked was Background.\n",
    "    Compared Background from platformer to adventureGame and saw that platformer's Background.js extends GameObject while adventureGame's Background.js doesn't\n",

    "    - Now returns error that Background is null\n",
    "    - Next steps im going to try are to implement a GameSetup.js and GameLevel.js from platformer to adventureGame\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Key Learning:**  \n",
    "  I learned the importance of using existing code and tracing functions back to their root definitions, especially when multiple functions interact.\n",
